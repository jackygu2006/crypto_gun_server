## Why I Have Created This?

There are many boilerplates available on the internet which providers a server app with nodejs, express & typescript but I found them either too complex for my use case or too simple where I need to configure lot of features later. So I build this repo to be used in projects which are simple & doesn't require lot of unnecessary tooling.

## Features

- **Simple Code** with no unnecessary dependencies.
- **JSON & Cookie** parsing support with no need of configurations.
- **Environment variables** can be easily added in file `.env` using library like [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).
- **Logging** support using libraries like [winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) & [morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan)
- **Prettier & ESlint** added so that your code looks & feels consistent.
